                  Since information is filed by age group and topic, teachers
                  can easily get practical ideas that are relevant to their
                  current curriculum without wading through lots of ideas that
                  won’t quite work for their individual situations. With plenty
                  of videos and fun quizzes, MAD can be a fun place to browse
                  even if you aren’t looking for anything specific.
